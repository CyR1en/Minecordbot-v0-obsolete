# MineCordBot
Bridge Minecraft and Discord using MineCordBot.

## Feature
* Bind a channel to minecraft
* Custom commands that applies to both Minecraft and Discord server.
* Do Discord bot commands from minecraft. (Still working on a feature to do it vice versa)

## More Info
This is a project for my Minecraft Server. I use it so that players could interact
with everyone in-game or not.

The plugin is currently in a very early stage, and once the plugin is done, I will be
glad to release it so everybody could use it and use it to make your Discord and
Minecraft servers better. (Even though you can build jar file by yourseld :3)

Bot is also written in Java for easier Minecraft support.

## Dependencies
  * JDA
  * CraftBukkit1.x
